## Gender Classification from Transfer Learning

### Introduction
Gender classification has been used in lots of maching learning applications. Classifying gender of a person can be simple for humans but it's still an active problem in modern computer vision. State-of-the-art face detection algorithms have reached high accuracy on available benchmark datasets. This project implements transfer learning on gender classification with the help of pretrained vgg-16 face descriptor model.

The pretrained weights can be downloaded from [Pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gFwEhuTMfdy5jLdYOx_x38MXTly4GurQ), which was extracted from original VGG Face Descriptor Caffe model (The original model can be downloaded from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/)).
