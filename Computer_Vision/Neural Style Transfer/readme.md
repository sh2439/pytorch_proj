# Neural Style Transfer
---

This notebook contains a typical machine learning/computer vision problem: **Neural Style Transfer**. With a content image (C) and a style image (S), we are able to generate a image (G) with C's content and S's style. The following images show how a photo can be combined with Van Gogh's painting and generate a new image.

<img src="sea.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
<center>Content Image: C</center>  

<img src="van.jpg" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
<center>Style Image: S</center> 
<img src="G_van.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
<center>Generated Image: G</center>
